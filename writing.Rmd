# Introduction

## Using the App

There are two ways we recommend using swirlify to write lessons. One way is to
use the shiny course authoring app we've created which can be launched using
the `swirlify()` function like so:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# If you're creating a new course, or if you're switching from one lesson in a 
# course to another lesson in the same course.
swirlify("My Lesson", "My Course")

# If your current lesson is set you can just use:
swirlify()
```

The app contains a text editor and a series of text boxes that will help you
write each question. You can choose what kind of question you want to write from
a drop-down menu. Later in this document we'll describe how these different
questions work in swirl.

## Using a Text Editor and `wq_` functions

You can also use a text editor and an R console to write questions in a lesson.
Type `W` + `Q` + `Tab` in the R console in order to see all of the `wq_` 
functions available ("wq" stands for "write question"). Executing any one of 
those functions will add a questions template to the current lesson. You can 
then fill in this question template in your text editor. Since you will be 
using a text editor and the R console together, we highly recommend using [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/) for writing your lesson.

# General `lesson.yaml` Structure

Lessons are sequences of questions that have the following general structure:

```
- Class: [type of question]
  Key1: [value1]
  Key2: [value2]

- Class: [type of question]
  Key1: [value1]
  Key2: [value2]
...
```

The example above shows the high-level structure for two questions. Each
question is demoarcated with a hyphen. Every question starts with a `Class` that
specifies that question's behavior inside of swirl. What follows the class is a
set of key-value pairs that will be used to render the question when a student 
is using swirl.

# Types of Questions

## The Meta Question

The first question in every `lesson.yaml` is always the meta question which
contains general information about the course. Below is an example of the meta
question:

```
- Class: meta
  Course: My Course
  Lesson: My Lesson
  Author: Jennifer Bryan
  Type: Standard
  Organization: The University of British Columbia
  Version: 2.5
```
The meta question will not be displayed to a student. The only fields you should
modify are `Author` and `Organization` fields.

## Message Questions

Message questions display a string of text in the R console for the student to 
read. Once the student presses enter, swirl will move on to the next question.

Add a message question using `wq_message()`. 

Here's an example message question:

```
- Class: text
  Output: Welcome to my first swirl course!
```

The student will see the following in the R console:

```
| Welcome to my first swirl course!

...
```

## Command Questions

Command questions prompt the student to type an expression into the R console.

- The `CorrectAnswer` is entered into the console if the student uses the `skip()`
function. 
- The `Hint` is displayed to the student if they don't get the question right.
- The `AnswerTests` determine whether or not the student answered the question
correctly. See the answer testing section for more information.

Add a message question using `wq_command()`. 

Here's an example command question:

```
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Add 2 and 2 together using the addition operator.
  CorrectAnswer: 2 + 2
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='2 + 2')
  Hint: Just type 2 + 2.
```

The student will see the following in the R console:

```
| Add 2 and 2 together using the addition operator.

>
```

## Multiple Choice Questions

Multiple choice questions present a selection of options to the student. These
options are presented in a different order every time the question is seen.

- The `AnswerChoices` should be a semicolon separated string of choices that
the student will have to choose from.

Add a message question using `wq_multiple()`. 

Here's an example multiple choice question:

```
- Class: mult_question
  Output: What is the capital of Canada?
  AnswerChoices: Toronto;Montreal;Ottawa;Vancouver
  CorrectAnswer: Ottawa
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='Ottawa')
  Hint: This city contains the Rideau Canal.
```

The student will see the following in the R console:

```
| What is the capital of Canada?

1: Toronto
2: Montreal
3: Ottawa
4: Vancouver
```

## Figure Questions

Figure questions are designed to show graphics to the student.

- `Figure` is an R script located in the lesson folder that will draw the figure.
- `FigureType` must be either `new` or `add`.
    - `new` specifies that a new figure is being drawn.
    - `add` specifies that more features are being added to a figure that
    already has been drawn, for example if you were adding a line or a legend to
    a plot that had been drawn in a preceding figure question.
    
Add a message question using `wq_figure()`. 

Here's an example figure question:

```
- Class: figure
  Output: Look at this figure!
  Figure: draw.R
  FigureType: new
```

The student will see the following in the R console:

```
| Look at this figure!

...
```

The student will also see the figure in the appropriate graphics device.

## Video/URL Questions

Video/URL questions give students the choice to open a URL in their web browser.

- `VideoLink` is the URL that will be opened in the student's web browser.

Add a message question using `wq_video()`. 

Here's an example video/URL question:

```
- Class: video
  Output: Do you want to go to Google?
  VideoLink: https://www.google.com/
```

The student will see the following in the R console:

```
| Do you want to go to Google?

Yes or No?
```

## Numerical Questions

Numerical questions ask the student to type an exact number into the R console.

Add a message question using `wq_numerical()`. 

Here's an example numerical question:

```
- Class: exact_question
  Output: How many of the Rings of Power were forged by the elven-smiths of
    Eregion?
  CorrectAnswer: 19
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal = 19)
  Hint: Three Rings for the Elven-kings under the sky, Seven for the Dwarf-lords
  in their halls of stone, Nine for Mortal Men doomed to die...
```

The student will see the following in the R console:

```
| How many of the Rings of Power were forged by the elven-smiths of Eregion?

>
```

## Text Questions

Text questions ask the student to type an phrase into the R console.

Add a message question using `wq_text()`. 

Here's an example text question:

```
- Class: text_question
  Output: What is the name of the programming language invented by 
    John Chambers?
  CorrectAnswer: 'S'
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal = 'S')
  Hint: What comes after R in the alphabet?
```

The student will see the following in the R console:

```
| What is the name of the programming language invented by John Chambers?

ANSWER:
```

## Script Questions

Script questions might be the hardest questions to write, however the payoff
in a student's understanding of how R works is proportional. Script questions
require that you write a custom answer test in order to evaluate the correctness
of a script that a student has written. Writing custom answer tests is covered
thoroughly in the answer testing section.

- `Script` is an R script that will be opened once the student reaches this
question. You should include this script in a subdirectory of the lesson folder
called "scripts". You should also
include in the "scripts directory" a version of this script that passes the 
answer test. The name of the
file for the correct version of the script shoud end in `-correct.R`. So if the
name of the script that the student will need to edit is `script.R` there should
be a corresponding `script-correct.R`.

Add a message question using `wq_script()`. 

Here's an example script question:

```
- Class: script
  Output: Write a function that calculates the nth fibonacci number.
  AnswerTests: test_fib()
  Hint: You could write this function recursively!
  Script: fib.R
```

The student will see the following in the R console:

```
| Write a function that calculates the nth fibonacci number.

>
```

Here's an example `fib.R`:

```
# Write a function that returns the nth fibonacci number. Think about
# what we just reviewed with regard to writing recurisive functions.

fib <- function(n){
  # Write your code here.
}
```

Here's an example `fib-correct.R`:

```
# Write a function that returns the nth fibonacci number. Think about
# what we just reviewed with regard to writing recurisive functions.

fib <- function(n){
  if(n == 0){
    return(0)
  } else if(n == 1 || n == 2){
    return(1)
  } else {
    return(fib(n-2) + fib(n-1))
  }
}
```

Here's an example `customTests.R` which includes `test_fib()`:

```
test_fib <- function() {
  try({
    func <- get('fib', globalenv())
    t1 <- identical(func(1), 1)
    t2 <- identical(func(20), 6765)
    t3 <- identical(sapply(1:12, func), c(1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144))
    ok <- all(t1, t2, t3)
  }, silent = TRUE)
  exists('ok') && isTRUE(ok)
}
```
